          East Hamilton's residents are familiar with the hum of industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there's one sound that stands out from the background hum. It's louder, more disruptive, and can be heard clearly across neighbourhoods more than 2 km away.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the noise that coincides with the flaring of gas from the largest flare in ArcelorMittal Dofasco's facility.

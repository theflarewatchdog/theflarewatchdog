      East Hamilton's residents are familiar with the hum of industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there's one noise that stands out from the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's heard when ArcelorMittal Dofasco's largest gas flare is lit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's loud enough to ring clearly throughout neighbourhoods more than 2 km away.
